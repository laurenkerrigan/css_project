                        <p>All sales are final. No refunds. Verify all information (title, date, time, 
                            seat selection, etc.) before purchasing tickets. <strong>Please Note: All ticket exchange 
                            requests must be made at least 24 hours before your scheduled performance. Requests 
                            made inside of 24 hours before or anytime after your scheduled performance will 
                            not be eligible for on-account credit, exchange, or refund.</strong></p>
                        <p>Subscribers may exchange tickets free of charge — one of the many subscriber benefits! Single-ticket 
                            holders may exchange for an additional fee ($5 per ticket). You may exchange tickets online, in person, 
                            or by phone for another performance within the same season, or receive on-account credit*. There is an 
                            additional cost if seating upgrades apply, and all exchange requests are subject to availability. You may 
                            also donate your tickets back to the Colorado Symphony and receive a donation receipt.</p>
                        <h3 style="margin-top: 40px;">Concert Cancellations & Postponements</h3>
                        <p>In the event that a concert is cancelled, postponed, or rescheduled ticket holders will be contacted via 
                            email with new event information (or ticket return instructions) as soon as possible. Unless notified otherwise, 
                            your tickets will be valid for the new event date. If you are unable to attend the new event date a refund 
                            will be issued upon request.</p>
                        <h3 style="margin-top: 40px;">Ticketing Terms & Conditions</h3>

                            by the Colorado Symphony Box Office. Service fees apply to all ticket purchases. Performances in city-owned 
                            venues (like Boettcher Concert Hall) include a 10% Facilities Development Admissions Tax (Seat Tax) will be added,

                        <p>Tickets purchased from a source other than Colorado Symphony may be lost, stolen, fake, or otherwise violate our terms or 
                            policies. Such tickets will not be honored.</p>
                        <p>The Colorado Symphony does not guarantee the authenticity of tickets purchased from any third party reseller (such as brokers or 
                            individuals). <strong>tickets.coloradosymphony.org</strong> is the official online ticketing provider for the Colorado Symphony.</p>
                        <p><strong>Tickets may not be resold for more than face value.</strong> Colorado Symphony reserves the right to not sell a ticket to any person or organization 
                            if we have knowledge or reason to believe that the purchase is for resale above face value or would otherwise violate the Colorado 
                            Symphony terms, conditions, and policies. Ticket purchasers who are identified as having violated the terms, conditions, or policies or 
                            having purchased with the intent to violate the terms, conditions, and policies may have their accounts closed, tickets revoked, admission refused, 
                            delivery method change, and/or future purchases refused.</p>

                        <h3 style="margin-top: 40px;">On-Account Credit</h3>
                        <p>If you received on-account credit for a ticket return or exchange, you may use this credit through the conclusion of the concert season in which it was given. 
                            Credit from the 2024/25 Season may only be used for concerts at Boettcher Concert Hall through June 1, 2025. After this date, all unused on-account credit 
                            will be converted into a tax-deductible donation to the Colorado Symphony.</p>
                        <p><strong>To use your credit towards a purchase, please contact the Box Office at (303) 623-7876. On-account credit cannot be used for online purchases.</strong></p>

                        <p>The Colorado Symphony is dedicated to providing our patrons with the best possible experience. With this in mind, all of our ticketing is managed by our own in-house box office.</p>

                            best live symphonic music in Colorado.</strong></p>
                        <p>The service fee covers the cost of selling the actual tickets. These costs include, but are not limited to:</p>

                        <p>Anyone charging an admission fee for an event held on property that is owned or leased by the City and County of Denver must collect a <strong>Facilities Development Admissions Tax of 10%</strong> of the
                            price of each admission and remit these taxes to the Denver Department of Revenue. This tax is commonly referred to as a “City seat tax” or “seat tax.” This tax applies to your Colorado 
                            Symphony ticket because we rent Boettcher Concert Hall from the City and County of Denver.</p>
